A comprehensive collection of wxWidgets example applications is now available to the community. These applications were originally developed as supplementary material for the book **"Cross-Platform Programming with C++ and wxWidgets 3"** and are now publicly accessible on GitHub. All example applications are released under the **wxWidgets License**.

**GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/bartoszwarzocha/wxwidgets_book_examples](https://github.com/bartoszwarzocha/wxwidgets_book_examples)  
**Book (PL):** [PWN - Cross-Platform Programming with C++ and wxWidgets 3](https://ksiegarnia.pwn.pl/Programowanie-wieloplatformowe-z-C-i-wxWidgets-3,750527898,p.html)

### Repository Contents

The repository contains more than 25 example applications, showcasing various wxWidgets functionalities. These include, among others:

- User interface components and custom controls
- File handling, logging, and system operations
- Networking (HTTP, FTP, and Socket communication)
- Multithreading
- OpenGL and 3D graphics
- Developing a custom code editor with wxScintilla

Additionally, some projects demonstrate more advanced features, making them useful for both beginners and experienced developers looking to integrate wxWidgets into their applications.

**Tested on:**  
- **Windows 11** (Visual Studio 2022, wxWidgets 3.3.x)  
- **Linux Mint 22** (wxWidgets 3.2.6)  

Each project includes configuration files for **Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, and Makefile**, ensuring compatibility across different development environments.

All examples have been fully translated into English to support a global audience of developers.

All projects have been **re-tested, updated, and adapted to the latest versions of wxWidgets and C++20**, ensuring modern compatibility and performance.

The repository also includes the **upgrade_wxwidgets.py** script, which facilitates both upgrading and adapting projects to any version of the wxWidgets library.

_This resource provides an excellent starting point for developers interested in exploring wxWidgets through working examples. Users are encouraged to review the code and adapt it to their own projects._
